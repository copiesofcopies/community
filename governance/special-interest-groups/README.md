# Special Interest Groups
Special Interest Groups provide a venue to discuss and compare notes on a common topic of interest. SIGs governance is documented [here](https://github.com/finos/community/tree/master/governance#special-interest-groups). 

Here's a list of special interest groups (SIGs) currently active in FINOS:

| Name  | Charter | Chair | URL  | Approved on  |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Open Source Readiness| Be a trusted venue for our Members and Community in their open source journey and enable them to achieve the highest state of open source maturity.| Reza Alavi (Wipro), Sundeep Dadlani (RBC) |https://github.com/finos/open-source-readiness| April 21st 2021|
|Financial Objects| Provide a neutral forum for individuals across the financial services industry to collectively identify the need for new, open, financial objects standards as well as modifications to  existing ones. Work to promote adoption of financial object definitions and models that support common industry workflows and use cases.| Ffion Acland (Goldman Sachs), Ian Sloyan (ISDA) |https://github.com/finos/finos-fo/| April 21st 2021|
|  Innersource | Create a safe space to identify and share challenges and solutions that accelerate Financial Services organizations’ efforts to implement InnerSource | Chair: Daniela Zheleva, DB Co-chair: Arthur Maltson / Roderick Randolph, Capital One  |  https://github.com/finos/InnerSource/  | January 20st 2021 - [See Proposal](https://github.com/finos/community/blob/master/governance/special-interest-groups/202101%20-%20InnerSource%20SIG%20Proposal%20-%20APPROVED.pdf) |
|  Regulation Innovation | The Regulation Innovation SIG will be a community of people interested in creating open source solutions for regulatory and compliance issues. Creating open source solutions to regulatory compliance is particularly important because the market is currently using custom-built, one-off solutions, that are expensive, inefficient, and costly to manage and update over time.  | Ian Hollowbread (ING), David Ehrich (AIR)  |  https://github.com/finos/open-regtech  | October 21st 2020 |
|  DevOps Mutualization | Identify and share homegrown solutions that enable regulated enterprises to manage the engineering toolchain, from ‘admin proxies’ to ‘glue to connect multiple tools together’, whilst finding opportunities to collaborate with the FINOS Community and possibly set standards on how these challenges should be addressed. | Amol Shukla (Morgan Stanley), Anders Wallgren (CloudBees) | https://github.com/finos-labs/devops-mutualization  | October 21st 2020 |
|  Diversity & Inclusion| To demonstrably improve diversity of FINOS through increased participation of underrepresented people on the Board, among FINOS team members, and the FINOS community | Alejandra Villagra (Citi) | On October 21st 2020, the Board ratified this group operating as a Board committee vs a SIG. Further updates will be puslished at a later stage. | July 15th 2020 |
    

## Want to propose a new SIG?

If you are FINOS member and you'd like to propose a new SIG for Board approval, [just raise an issue](https://github.com/finos/community/issues/new?assignees=aitana16%2C+maoo&labels=contribution&template=Special-Interest-Group-Contribution.md&title=Special+Interest+Group+Contribution+and+Onboarding)

## Other potential SIGs

The FINOS Governing could be looking at converting into SIGs existing long running initiatives like:

- [Open Source Readiness Project](https://finosfoundation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/OSR/pages/154435612/Open+Source+Readiness+Working+Group)
- [Open Developer Platform Project](https://github.com/finos/open-developer-platform/)
